> This file contains customisation options for tailoring the script more to your liking.

> Usage:
> <path name>
> <flag(s)>

> Flags apply to every file in the path's directory and sub-directories. For example, writing:

> C:\Users\UserName\Documents\Sports Interactive\Football Manager 2024
> IGNORE_MISSING_IMAGES

> would silence reports about missing images everywhere inside the FM graphics folder.

> CONFIG FILE CHANGES
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

> By default, the script does not convert the config files from UTF-8-BOM to UTF-8, but instead gives an error. This
> flag instructs the script to do this conversion and save the config files.
> CONVERT_UTF-8-BOM

> By default, the script does not delete duplicate records in the config files. Duplicate record means a record sharing
> the same source and destination with one or more records in the config file. This flag instructs the script to only
> leave unique records in the config files, and save the changes.
> DELETE_DUPLICATE_RECORDS

> By default, the script does not delete records where the image is missing. This flag instructs the script to delete
> those records, and save the config file.
> NOTE: If both this and IGNORE_MISSING_IMAGES have been activated, this flag overrides the other.
> DELETE_RECORDS_WITH_MISSING_IMAGE

> By default, the script does not make any visual changes to the config files. This flag instructs the script to make
> the config files more readable and save them. Note that this also deletes any comments that the config files may have.
> REFORMAT_CONFIG_FILES

> IGNORING REPORTS
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

> By default, the script reports all records that do not have a corresponding image file. This flag ignores those
> reports.
> NOTE: If both this and DELETE_RECORDS_WITH_MISSING_IMAGE have been activated, this flag has no effect.
> IGNORE_MISSING_IMAGES

> By default, the script reports all images that do not have a config record tied to them. This flag ignores those
> reports.
> IGNORE_MISSING_RECORDS

> By default, the script reports all cases of one image being used in several records. This flag ignores those reports.
> IGNORE_MULTI_USE_IMAGES

> By default, the script reports all files that are not images. The distinction between an image and non-image is done
> based on the list of file extensions given in image_file_extensions.txt file. This flag ignores those reports.
> IGNORE_NON-IMAGE_FILES

> By default, the script reports all records where the image file name is a number, but that number is different from
> the destination path's ID. This flag ignores those reports.
> IGNORE_NON-MATCHING_IDS
